[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker)

A **serverless wrapper** for the private Notion API. It provides fast and easy access to your Notion content.
Ideal to make Notion your CMS.

We provide a hosted version of this project on [`https://notion-api.splitbee.io`](https://notion-api.splitbee.io/). You can also [host it yourself](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). Cloudflare offers a generous free plan with up to 100,000 request per day.

_Use with caution. This is based on the private Notion API. We can not gurantee it will stay stable._

## Features

üç≠ **Easy to use** ‚Äì Receive Notion data with a single GET request

üóÑ **Table Access** ‚Äì Get structured data from tables & databases

‚ú® **Blazing Fast** ‚Äì Built-in [SWR](https://www.google.com/search?q=stale+while+revalidate) caching for instant results

üõ´ **CORS Friendly** ‚Äì Access your data where you need it

## Use Cases

- Use it as data-source for blogs and documentation. Create a table with pages and additional metadata. Query the `/table` endpoints everytime you want to render a list of all pages.

- Get data of specific pages, which can be rendered with [`react-notion`](https://github.com/splitbee/react-notion)

## Endpoints

### Load page data

`/v1/page/<PAGE_ID>`

Example ([Source Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/react-notion-example-2e22de6b770e4166be301490f6ffd420))

[`https://notion-api.splitbee.io/v1/page/2e22de6b770e4166be301490f6ffd420`](https://notion-api.splitbee.io/v1/page/2e22de6b770e4166be301490f6ffd420)

Returns all block data for a given page.
For example, you can render this data with [`react-notion`](https://github.com/splitbee/react-notion).

### Load data from table

`/v1/table/<PAGE_ID>`

Example ([Source Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/splitbee/20720198ca7a4e1b92af0a007d3b45a4?v=4206debfc84541d7b4503ebc838fdf1e))

[`https://notion-api.splitbee.io/v1/table/20720198ca7a4e1b92af0a007d3b45a4`](https://notion-api.splitbee.io/v1/table/20720198ca7a4e1b92af0a007d3b45a4)

## Authentication for private pages

All public pages can be accessed without authorization. If you want to fetch private pages there are two options.

- The recommended way is to host your own worker with the `NOTION_TOKEN` environment variable set. You can find more information in the [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/apis/environment-variables/).
- Alternatively you can set the `Authorization: Bearer <NOTION_TOKEN>` header to authorize your requests.

### Receiving the token

To obtain your token, login to Notion and open your DevTools and find your cookies. There should be a cookie called `token_v2`, which is used for the authorization.
